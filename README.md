# üõí Spring-Microservices-Ecom-app

Built a scalable e-commerce platform using Spring Boot microservices (Product, Inventory, Cart, Order, Auth), integrated with Eureka Service Registry and API Gateway, secured with JWT authentication, and backed by MongoDB.
The project demonstrates **service decomposition, inter-service communication, centralized routing, and JWT authentication**.
